                <h2>Data that Companies Collect</h2>
                <h3>Data About the User</h3>
                <p>Data companies can construct portfolios about their users’ identities; these portfolios are worth tremendous values to third party advertising businesses who want to use information about customers to manipulate them into buying products. To see exactly how this works we can turn to one of the largest data collection companies in the world, Apple. When you check agree to the terms of use box under the contract that needs to be checked in order to use any Apple product, you are allowing Apple to collect information about “your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information and credit card information… information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used”(“Legal - Privacy Policy - Apple”). Apple knows everything about their users: where they live, what language they speak, and even their job. Apple then compiles all this information into a pricy portfolio about you.</p>
                <h3>Data About the Information</h3>
                <p>Data companies also collect information on that data their users share. The community of Facebook have all agreed the company’s policy that “the content, communications and other information you provide when you use the Service, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others… the content you provide (such as metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created; content, communications and information that other people provide when they use the Service”(“FB_Work_Privacy”) are all allowed to be collected and stored by Facebook. The fact that this is not only completely legal, but companies like Facebook do this as a day to day practice is insane. This would be the equivalent of the mailman opening individual’s letters and writing down any information they deem of importance. When you post a photo on Facebook, not only are you sharing the information you can see in the photo, but images have metadata attached to them that can include the exact date, time, and location the photo was taken. With people now taking and posting images every time they leave the house; they are constantly being tracked by Facebook. Most users are never made aware of this, however, and in turn do not fully comprehend how much of their privacy is being violated by these industry standards.</p>
                <h3>Data About the Client</h3>
                <p>A first thought may be that this is no big deal compared to the fact that these businesses are able to store such information as a person’s house address. As the world we live in becomes more digitized, collecting data about our cellphones and computers can have serious reproductions for individuals. Google may be the most prevalent company that uses these methods to violate their user’s privacy. Although many people think that Google is a free to use completely anonymous site, most users have a google account, and this is how google can track their users. When users make a google account, they agree that google can store information about “unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number… the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request”(“Google Privacy Police”). With this information that Google is collecting they can construct a digital portfolio about everything one does on the Internet. Google knows what apps and programs one uses, how often ones uses them, and when and where one uses them; which in turn can be used to put ads they know specifically target a person on those specific apps and programs. Now, even when one is not online, data companies are still able to manipulate people and violate their privacy.</p>
