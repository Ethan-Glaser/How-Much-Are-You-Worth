                <p>On January 1st, 1983, the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency created an innovation that has forever changed the way individuals, organizations, and all of society interacts with one another. The ARPAnet, now known as the Internet, was invented as a way for US intelligence to communicate securely during the Cold War. Now the Internet is a staple in our culture, and it would be hard to imagine a world without it. Over the past few years, the popularity of the World Wide Web has boomed. As more people use the Internet more information is recorded, stored, and analyzed. In fact, “90% of the world’s data was generated in the last two years” (Young). This way of storing and analyzing information has caught the eye of big corporations such as Google, Apple, and Facebook looking to make a big profit off the information you supply them. </p>
