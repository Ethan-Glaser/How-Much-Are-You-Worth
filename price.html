                <h2>Turning your Data into Money</h2>
                <p>Due to businesses having no limit on the amount and type of data that can be collected about a user, the files of information they are able to generate as they gather information about a user become not only enormous, but also pricy. This is how these companies collect a profit, by selling private information about users that use their platform to third party advertisers. Your data is not technically your property anymore; it is an asset of the company. The company can then choose to sell this data to whoever they want with no consent needed from you. Enterprises like Facebook specifically state in their terms of use that they can sell your data “to third-party service providers that assist in providing the Service or part of the Service” (“FB_Work_Privacy”). These advertisers then use this information to place targeted ads on the platforms that they know the user will see to try to manipulate users into buying their products. Data companies know this and even state that “Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests” (“Google Privacy Police”). Instantly everything users’ have supplied these data companies is not only being used for companies like Facebook to make a quick profit, but these advertisers are now manipulating the customer with their own personal information to make a profit. Data companies are benefiting, advertisers are benefiting, and users are losing, all due to the data that people supply. This is manipulation of the users on the platform; businesses are violating individual’s rights to personal privacy and are turning it to profit.</p>
