                <h2>What's the Problem</h2>
                <h3>Too Much Power in our Society</h3>
                <p>The problem with these Big Data businesses is that they have accumulated too much power in our society. The Internet was never created to be used to the extent it is currently being used at today. Due to this, no rules or regulations were ever set in place. The early days of the Internet were like the Wild West and just now governments are trying to play catch up and tighten the leash of what is and is not permissible online. This has been seen with the passing of such regulations like the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In 1996, the US government called in to question the credit and banking industry. The government thought that the banks were collecting more than needed information on their clients. As a result, they amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act adding verbiage that ensures these businesses “establish ‘reasonable measures’ addressing the commercial need for consumer credit information in a manner that ensures ‘confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization’ of the information” (Wilson). The problem with this is that the law never clearly states what relevancy means. Companies can get around these loosely set regulations very easily claiming that the information they are collecting and storing all are relevant to the algorithms that run their operations. They can cheat abuse the system to over collect data on their customers to gain more profits. The system currently in place needs to be corrected and rewrote to ensure that users’ information is adequately protected. However, for a lot of these companies it is too late. For years, corporations like Google have been able to “accumulate—essentially, without limit—as much sensitive, personal data as they can get their hands on” (Sadowski). Legally Google has done nothing wrong, however, these enterprises have a moral obligation to protect society's privacy and to ensure security and anonymity. Data companies have abused this power and need to be limited on what information they can track about their users.</p>
                
                <p>Without limiting the information these companies can collect, they are able to use this data to manipulate individuals, different corporations, and even our government to continue to gain more power. Data is the newest commodity that everyone wants to get their hands on, “In terms of power and wealth, the data capitalists are already usurping the oil barons and hedge fund managers, as Olivia Solon and Sabrina Siddiqui report. ‘It used to be banks, but now it is tech giants that dominate the US lobbying industry” (Sadowski). The more information you have the more the data bank is worth. Businesses like Apple and Google have taken the place of oil and energy companies, like Exxon, as one of the most powerful lobbying groups. This is a major flaw in the system that is currently in place. Shady deals happen in the background that end up benefiting the company instead of the consumer. There needs to be “more transparency and accountability in the data broker industry” (Sadowski).  These businesses should not be able to have any amount of control on the entities that regulate them. Yet, because of the data that they have amounted the government has to rely on them; not just for the information they have, but also as a backbone in our current economy. The data industry is booming in the U.S.; in fact, “most large U.S. businesses and commercial entities were heavily invested in the use of digital data collection to formulate business strategy and practice” (“Privacy in the Digital Age”). The government allows for these practices to continue because they stimulate the economy. This is not right; the rights of a business should never come before the rights of an individual. The government, however, is choosing to protect the Googles of the world because they provide benefits for them. This bias that data companies have over our government is unconstitutional and needs to be stopped in order to protect the rights of the citizens. Stricter regulations need to be put in place to stop the data industry from accumulating too information to the point that they have this much power over the government in order to ensure the privacy of users.</p>
                <h3>Security Breeches and Loss of Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>Another big issue to think about is the security that has to be in place to protect all of this data. All the information that these companies track about users is kept and stored on servers. These servers, although usually heavily protected and secure, are still accessible via the Internet. This can lead to a major privacy breach for users. These portfolios that companies keep on their users are worth a lot of money to companies like Apple and Facebook, money that criminals would love to get their hands on. As the Internet grows in popularity so does cybercrime, and we can no longer turn a blind eye to the problem and just ignore it.  Data companies try to protect us, but the fact of the matter is “The vaults of these databanks are impossible to secure, in large part, because the wealth of information they hold is a beacon for hackers” (Sadowski). The only way to detract attention from these data banks is to devalue them and remove the excessive information these companies store about users. Companies must protect the individuals on their platform and limit the amount of data they collect on users before there is a breach and the user’s privacy is stolen forever.</p>
                
                <p>Even users who think they have securely protected their personal information can be at risk. Everything now at days is connected by the Internet, even the workers computers at these data corporations. All it takes is one worker’s computer to be hacked for millions of user’s personal information to be breached. Almost every company, no matter how big or small, now uses computers for their daily operations. These computers are usually connected by a Local Area Network which allows for the “exchange of information between the linked computers” (Hoyle). Companies are constantly spreading are sharing information with anonymous third-party businesses which becomes a big problem. All it takes is for one of these third-party advertising businesses worker’s computer to get hacked; suddenly every user on that platform identity is stolen.
